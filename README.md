# Taskmin Version 1.0
> my personal flavor of To-Do List App  

I'm building a Terminal based task list application. I want to be able to run this at a command line or to be able to compile into it's own Terminal based application.  

## Application Requirements
1. The application creates numbered, editable task lists.
2. The application saves and loads lists as/from text files (.txt)
3. Upon running the software, a main menu displayed with the following options:  
``` 
(1) Create New List
(2) Load List
(3) Help
(0) Exit 
``` 
4. Selecting 'Help' should display a screen of text that explains how the software works.  
	+ selecting 'Exit' should exit the program
5. When selecting 'Create New List', the user should be prompted to enter a title for the list.
	- After which they are presented with the Task List view of an empty list. As tasks are added to the list, they should be displayed here as well.
```
(1) Add Task
(2) Remove Task
(3) Change Title
(4) Save List
(0) Exit
```
